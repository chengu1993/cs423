=================================================
I run the Test program 10 times with size of reference string equal to 50 and
number of frames equal to 7.

#fames  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10
FIFO    20 16 16 20 24 21 19 15 18 16
LRU     20 20 16 23 19 19 16 17 17 17

Does one algorithm perform better than the other?
No. We can see from the table above that sometimes FIFO performs better 
while sometimes LRU has less number of page faults. In reality, LRU should
be better than FIFO because there is a pattern in referenece string in reality.
However, the refernece string generated here is purely random. Knowing the past
does not necessarilly improve the performance.

Is there an optimal number of page frames for a given reference string size?
In this lab, yes. Let's consider the following 2 scenarios.

Scenarios 1: The reference string size is smaller than 10.
Let denote reference string size as S. Then the optimalnumber of page frames 
should be larger than or equal to the reference string size. Even all the 
page number in reference string is different. It will guarantee that there 
will only be S page faults.

Scenarios 2: The refernce string size is larger than or euqal to 10.
Becuase the generator only generate sequence with 1 to 9. As long as the 
number of page frames is larger than or equal to 10. There will be only 9 page
faults no matter what the reference string size is.
